# Finite Element Analysis: Stress Concentration in Plate with Hole

A complete 2D FEM solver built from scratch in Python to predict failure locations in engineering structures. Demonstrates advanced numerical methods, computational mechanics, and software engineering skills.

## Problem Statement & Impact

**Real Engineering Challenge**: When you drill holes in aircraft wings, pressure vessels, or mechanical components, stress concentrates around these holes at levels 2-3 times higher than the applied load. This concentration determines where cracks initiate and structures fail.

**Technical Achievement**: Built a finite element solver that accurately predicts these stress concentrations, matching theoretical solutions within engineering accuracy.

**Business Value**: This type of analysis prevents catastrophic failures in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering - potentially saving millions in redesign costs and ensuring safety compliance.

### Graphical Output:

**Deformed Shape**: This plot shows the exaggerated deformation of the plate under tensile load. The red dots represent the deformed nodes, while the grey dots show their original positions. The displacement is scaled by a factor of 1000 to make the deformation visible. The circular hole becomes slightly elliptical due to the stress distribution.

**von Mises Stress Distribution**: This contour plot illustrates the stress distribution across the plate. The highest stress (yellow region) is concentrated at the top and bottom edges of the hole, as predicted by theory. The white circle indicates the boundary of the hole.

## Running the Script:

To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script from your terminal:

The script will first print a summary of the mesh and solution, and then it will generate two plots: one for the von Mises stress distribution and one for the deformed shape. You can modify the parameters (L, H, R, nx, ny, sigma0) at the bottom of the script to explore different geometries and loading conditions.
